  <h2 class="myH2">Abstract</h2>
  <p class="myP">
    The World Health Organization states that depression is one of the most disabling diseases in the world, affecting more than 4% 
    of the world's population, mostly young people aged 15-29, causing alarming rates of suicide and other research points to the 
    difficulty that a person with depression has to talk about the subject outside the context of therapy. In view of these factors,
     the present work aims to develop a platform, called Phoenix, that allows greater interaction between the patient and the 
     psychologist, through two fronts: a platform for the visualization of data assisting in the frequent follow-up of the patient's 
     condition aimed at psychology professionals and a chatbot for the teenager with depression to talk about their routine. 
     Firstly, concepts about Depression in Psychology, Depression in Adolescence, Behavioral Cognitive Therapy as a Technique for 
     Depression Treatment and Psychology and Computer Science are presented, in which the possibility of using cognitive behavioral
      therapy in the project chatbot was identified and later, the application of unidentified questionnaires online with potential
       future users. The object of the study is depression in adolescence, and because it is a technological research, related works
        were analyzed in which it was possible to observe mainly the lack that the existing works have of the interface with the 
        psychology professional. On the platform, the following technologies will be used: Botkit Studio and Dialogflow for the 
        production of chatbot, the React library, developed by Facebook, for the creation of a web platform that are used by psychology 
        professionals and Java for the Web API, using the frameworks Spring Boot, Spring Security for data traffic security, and Spring
         Data for communication with the MySQL relational database. As results of the research, it is evident the lack of computerization 
         of the routine of psychotherapy with the interface with the professional development, besides indicating an acceptance of 
         technological innovations by the area of ​​psychology. In summary, it is possible to observe the importance of frequent follow-up 
         of patients who are in a depressive stage, allowing the development of a platform to assist in this monitoring. In general, the
          Phoenix platform is expected to offer the adolescent with depression a favorable environment so that he can talk even outside
           the context of therapy, as well as provide reports to the accompanying psychologist to have greater knowledge about the case 
           and stage of the illness.
